# Ultralytics Employee Travel Policy (2025)

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees of [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com) who are required to travel for business purposes. Employees are responsible for making their own travel arrangements while adhering to the guidelines outlined in this policy.

## Employee Responsibilities

- Travel must be business-critical, cost-effective, and approved by your manager prior to booking.
- Expense claims must include a clear description of the business purpose.
- Submit expenses promptly, ideally within the same fiscal quarter incurred.

## Per Diem Rates

Employees traveling for business will receive a daily per diem allowance based on their destination to cover meals, incidental expenses, and all ground transportation costs. Only airfare is reimbursable separately. The following rates apply:

| Office Location | Daily Per Diem Rate |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Madrid          | $229.00 per day     |
| London          | $284.50 per day     |
| Shenzhen        | $186.00 per day     |
| San Francisco   | $364.00 per day     |
| San Jose        | $284.00 per day     |

| Barcelona       | $174.00 per day     |
| Lisbon          | $175.00 per day     |

### Methodology

The daily per diem rates above are derived from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Department of State published per diem rates, adjusted by a 50% reduction for OCONUS locations to reflect Ultralytics' size and budget considerations.
