# Ultralytics Employee Relocation Policy üìç

## 1. Purpose and Scope üìå

This policy applies to high-value, full-time Ultralytics employees approved for relocation to one of our designated hub cities. The goal is to strategically position key talent to support business objectives. All relocations are subject to pre-approval from management and HR.

## 2. Eligibility Requirements ‚úÖ

Relocation assistance is reserved for employees who meet the following criteria:

- **Role:** Senior positions such as engineering leads, department heads, key technical contributors, or other strategic roles.
- **Performance:** Consistently meeting or exceeding performance expectations.
- **Tenure:** A minimum of six months of employment. This may be waived for strategic new hires or critical roles.
- **Business Need:** The relocation must be initiated by management for business-critical reasons or be a move that directly aligns with company strategic goals.

## 3. Approved Hub Cities üåé

Relocation reimbursement is **only** available for moves to the following Ultralytics hub cities:

| Hub Location | Region       |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| **Madrid**   | Europe       |
| **London**   | Europe       |
| **Shenzhen** | Asia-Pacific |

!!! warning "Non-Hub Relocations"

    Moves to cities not on this list are considered self-initiated and are not eligible for reimbursement under this policy.

## 4. Relocation Compensation üí∞

### Standard Reimbursement

Eligible employees will receive a **one-time, flat-rate payment of $6,000 USD**.

- **Coverage:** This payment is intended to cover all associated moving expenses, including but not limited to travel, shipping of personal belongings, and temporary accommodation.
- **Payment:** The reimbursement is processed as a lump sum in the first payroll cycle after the relocation is complete and the new address is confirmed.

### Non-Reimbursable Costs

The following situations are not covered by this policy:

- Relocations to non-hub cities.
- Self-initiated moves without a clear, pre-approved business justification.
- Temporary relocations (less than 12 months).
- Lateral moves that do not serve a strategic business purpose.

## 5. Approval Process üîÑ

1.  **Request Submission:** An employee's direct manager must submit a relocation request, including a strong business justification.
2.  **Management Review:** The request is reviewed by senior management. Approval is typically granted within 10 business days.
3.  **Confirmation:** Once approved, HR will provide a written confirmation and a formal relocation agreement to the employee.

!!! note "Documentation"

    The business case should include the employee's role, the strategic importance of the move, and a proposed timeline.

## 6. Employee Obligations ‚öñÔ∏è

### Tenure Commitment

- Employees who receive relocation assistance must remain employed with Ultralytics for a **minimum of 18 months** following their relocation date.
- **Repayment Clause:** If the employee voluntarily resigns before the 18-month period is complete, they will be required to repay the **full** relocation reimbursement amount.

### Documentation

- Employees must provide proof of their new residence in the hub city to finalize the process.
- While receipts for individual expenses are not required for the flat-rate reimbursement, it is wise to maintain records for personal tax purposes.

## 7. Important Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Tax Implications

The $6,000 relocation payment is considered a taxable benefit and will be subject to applicable income taxes. Employees are responsible for their own personal tax obligations and are encouraged to consult with a tax advisor.

### Remote & Hybrid Work

Relocation must align with the company's remote and hybrid work policies. Employees are expected to adhere to the work requirements specific to their new hub location, including any in-office expectations and timezone collaboration needs.

## 8. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy will be considered on a case-by-case basis for business-critical needs, such as strategic new hires or unforeseen operational requirements. All exceptions require written approval from senior management.
