# Documentation Directory (`docs/`)

Welcome to the `docs/` directory! This folder houses the source files for our project documentation, which is built and managed using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a popular static site generator.

## üìù Overview

-   **MkDocs Configuration:** The primary configuration file for MkDocs is `mkdocs.yml`, located in the repository root. This file dictates the documentation's structure, navigation, theme, and build settings.
-   **Documentation Files:** All documentation content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) format (`.md` files). These files are organized within this `docs/` directory, mirroring the structure defined in `mkdocs.yml`. You can find the main Ultralytics documentation at [https://docs.ultralytics.com/](https://docs.ultralytics.com/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To contribute to or preview the documentation locally:

1.  **Install MkDocs:** Make sure you have MkDocs and the necessary theme/plugins installed. Refer to the project's main `README.md` or contribution guidelines for specific setup instructions.
2.  **Preview Documentation:** Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal and run the command `mkdocs serve`. This starts a local development server, allowing you to view the documentation live in your web browser, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Changes made to the Markdown files will automatically reload the preview.
3.  **Build Documentation:** To generate the static HTML site (usually for deployment), run the command `mkdocs build`. This creates a `site/` directory containing the complete documentation website.

It's crucial to keep the documentation synchronized with the project's ongoing development. Clear, accurate, and up-to-date documentation benefits both internal developers and external users, ensuring everyone can effectively understand and utilize the project. For more details on contributing, see our [Contribution Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing/).

We appreciate your contributions to keeping our documentation excellent!
