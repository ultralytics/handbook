# Software Policy üíæ

## 1. Purpose and Guiding Principles

This policy governs the acquisition, installation, and use of all software on company-owned and managed devices. Our goal is to provide employees with the best tools to foster innovation and productivity while maintaining a secure and stable technology environment.

- **Security First:** The integrity of our data and systems is paramount.
- **Legal Compliance:** We use only properly licensed and approved software.
- **Productivity & Collaboration:** We standardize tools to ensure seamless collaboration across our global team.

## 2. Standard Software Suite üíª

All company-provided computers come with a standard suite of pre-installed and approved software to cover core business functions. This suite is managed by the IT department and includes the latest security updates.

### Core Application Categories

While the specific application list is maintained by IT, the standard suite includes:

- **Operating System:** The latest version of macOS.
- **Productivity Suite:** Core applications for documents, spreadsheets, and presentations (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft Office).
- **Communication:** Company-approved tools for email, chat, and video conferencing (e.g., Slack, Google Meet).
- **Security:** Mandatory antivirus, firewall, and device management software (**Rippling**).
- **Web Browsers:** Approved browsers like Google Chrome with required security extensions.
- **Technical Tools:** For developer and technical roles, this includes approved IDEs, code editors, and other development utilities.

## 3. Requesting and Installing New Software üì•

To maintain security and compatibility, all software not included in the standard suite must be approved before installation.

### Approval & Installation Process

1.  **Submit Request:** Send a software request to your direct manager, including a clear business justification and the cost, if any.
2.  **IT Security Review:** Your manager will forward the request to the IT department for a security and compatibility review. This step is mandatory to prevent vulnerabilities.
3.  **Final Approval:** Once IT gives its approval, your manager will provide the final sign-off.
4.  **Purchase & Installation:** For paid software, follow the standard [reimbursement procedures](../finance/index.md#reimbursements). IT will provide installation support if needed.

!!! warning "Prohibition of Unauthorized Software"

    The installation of any software that has not been approved through this process is strictly prohibited. This includes personal software on company devices, unlicensed or "cracked" applications, and any tool that could compromise system security.

## 4. Acceptable Use Policy üõ°Ô∏è

### Business vs. Personal Use

Company-provided software and devices are intended primarily for business purposes. However, we permit limited and reasonable personal use provided it:

- Does **not** interfere with your work performance or responsibilities.
- Does **not** compromise the security or integrity of company systems.
- Does **not** violate any other company policies.
- Does **not** incur any additional cost for the company.

### Prohibited Activities

The following activities are strictly forbidden on company devices:

- Using software for any illegal purpose, including copyright infringement.
- Installing or distributing unlicensed, pirated, or unauthorized software.
- Accessing, downloading, or distributing offensive, discriminatory, or pornographic material.
- Circumventing or disabling security measures, including antivirus and MDM software.
- Sharing confidential company information or data through unauthorized platforms.
- Engaging in any activity that could harm the company's reputation or systems.

## 5. Security and Compliance üîí

Every employee shares the responsibility for protecting our digital assets.

### System & Security Software

- **Antivirus & Malware Protection:** All devices must have company-approved security software installed and running at all times. Tampering with this software is a policy violation.
- **System Updates:** Keep your operating system and all applications updated. Enable automatic updates whenever possible to patch vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Firewall:** The built-in OS firewall must be enabled on all computers.

### Data Security

- **Handling Sensitive Data:** Use only company-approved applications and secure, encrypted channels for storing or transmitting confidential or sensitive information.
- **Backups:** While IT manages system-level backups, you are responsible for ensuring your critical work files are saved to approved cloud storage solutions (e.g., Google Drive) and not just locally on your device.

### Password Management

- **Password Manager:** Using a company-approved password manager is required. This helps create and store strong, unique passwords for every service.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA must be enabled on all accounts that support it, especially for critical systems like Google Workspace, Slack, and Rippling.

## 6. IT Support ü§ù

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- **High (Individual unable to work):** 4-hour response
- **Normal (Minor issue, software request):** 24-hour response
