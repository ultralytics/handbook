# Hardware Policy üíª

![Ultralytics Hardware Policy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d854e5c9-bf3a-45e5-979d-68d898d83f71)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy outlines the provisioning, management, and security of all hardware used by Ultralytics employees. Its purpose is to ensure everyone has the necessary tools to perform their roles effectively while protecting the company's assets and data. This policy applies to all full-time, part-time, and contract employees.

## 2. Hardware Refresh Cycle üîÑ

**All employees are eligible for a hardware refresh every two years.** This ensures our team is equipped with modern and efficient tools. Replacement requests outside this standard cycle require direct manager approval based on performance needs or hardware failure.

## 3. Standard Computer Equipment üñ•Ô∏è

### Default Configuration

**[MacBook Air (13", M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB Storage)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/)** - The standard configuration for all employees, balancing performance and portability.

### Technical/Developer Configuration

**[MacBook Pro (14", M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)** - Available for employees in technical and developer roles who require additional processing power.

!!! note "Weight Consideration"

    The MacBook Pro is heavier than the MacBook Air and may be less suitable for employees who travel frequently. Please consider this when selecting your device.

!!! warning "Keyboard Language"

    Ensure you order the correct keyboard layout for your language when requesting equipment.

### Custom Configurations

Any hardware configuration other than the two standards listed above is considered an exception and requires **direct manager approval** with a clear business justification.

## 4. New Hire Equipment Process üì¶

### Onsite Employees

- Your manager will coordinate with the IT department to have your equipment ready for you.
- You will receive your computer and accessories directly at your office location on your first day.

### Remote Employees

- You must independently order your approved equipment configuration.
- Submit receipts to the Finance team for reimbursement by following the standard [reimbursement procedures](../finance/index.md#reimbursements).
- It is highly recommended to confirm the purchase details with your manager before ordering to ensure a smooth reimbursement process.

### Standard Accessories

All new hires receive a pair of **[Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/)** to facilitate clear communication in video conferences and calls.

## 5. Hardware Replacements & Upgrades üîß

This process applies when replacing an existing device with a new one.

1.  **Request Approval:** Request replacement approval from your manager. This is automatically granted if you are within the 2-year refresh cycle.
2.  **Select Device:** Once approved, select your eligible device (MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, depending on your role).
3.  **Order and Trade-In:** Order the new device directly from Apple. **You MUST select the option to trade in your existing device** and provide its serial number during the order process.
4.  **Migrate Data:** Upon receiving your new device, migrate all data from your old device.
5.  **Return Old Device:** **IMPORTANT:** Ship your old device back to Apple using the provided trade-in kit via the [Apple Trade In](https://www.apple.com/trade-in/) program.
6.  **Submit for Reimbursement:** The reimbursed amount will be the **net cost (new device price - Apple trade-in credit)**. You will not be reimbursed for the full price of the new device.

!!! warning "Approval and Reimbursement Requirements"

    Your manager and the Finance team must see the **full order details** before approval. This includes both the new device price and the estimated trade-in credit for the old device.

## 6. Mobile Device Policy üì±

### Eligibility and Justification

- Company-provided mobile devices like [iPads](https://www.apple.com/ipad/), [iPhones](https://www.apple.com/iphone/), or Android devices are not standard issue and require **manager approval**.
- You must demonstrate a clear business necessity for the device. Examples include:
    - Frequent travel requiring constant access to work apps and email.
    - On-call duties that necessitate immediate response capabilities.
    - Roles that require testing on specific mobile platforms.

### Approval and Purchase Process

1.  Submit a request to your direct manager with a written business justification.
2.  Once approved by your manager, purchase the approved device.
3.  Request reimbursement from the Finance team with the receipt.

## 7. Device Management & Security üîí

### Rippling MDM: A Mandatory Requirement

**All devices used for work, whether company-provided or personally owned (under BYOD), must have Rippling Mobile Device Management (MDM) installed.**

- **Applies To:** MacBook Air/Pro, iPads, iPhones, and Android devices.
- **Installation:** Employees are responsible for installing Rippling MDM from **[app.rippling.com/enroll-device](https://app.rippling.com/enroll-device)**.
- **Timing:** MDM must be installed **before** the device is used to access any company data or systems.

### Security & Compliance Policies

All devices must adhere to company security requirements, which are enforced via Rippling MDM:

- **Hard Drive Encryption:** Full disk encryption (e.g., FileVault) must be enabled.
- **Strong Passwords:** Devices must be protected with a strong password.
- **Automatic Updates:** Security updates must be enabled to run automatically.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Devices are subject to regular compliance checks.
- **Remote Management:** The IT department has the ability to remotely lock or wipe company data from devices to protect information if a device is lost or stolen.

!!! warning "Strict Compliance Enforcement"

    Devices that do not have Rippling MDM installed and configured correctly are not permitted for work use and will be blocked from accessing company resources.

## 8. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy ü§ù

While company-provided hardware is the standard, Ultralytics permits the use of personal devices for work in limited, pre-approved circumstances.

- **Approval Required:** Using a personal device for work requires explicit approval from your manager and the IT department.
- **MDM is Mandatory:** Any approved personal device **must** be enrolled in Rippling MDM. This allows the company to manage and secure its data without accessing your personal information.
