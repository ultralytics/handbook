# Ultralytics Engineering workflows

## Our Mission

We as engineers, contributors, and maintainers are committed to building robust, secure, and innovative solutions that advance the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Our engineering practices prioritize code quality, security, and collaborative development to ensure the reliability and integrity of our products.

We pledge to maintain the highest standards of software engineering while fostering an environment of continuous learning, knowledge sharing, and technical excellence.

## Core Engineering Principles

Our engineering culture is built on the following foundational principles:

- **Code Quality**: We write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code that stands the test of time
- **Security First**: We implement security best practices at every stage of development
- **Collaborative Development**: We believe that multiple perspectives improve code quality and reduce risk
- **Continuous Learning**: We embrace new technologies and methodologies that enhance our development process
- **Transparency**: We maintain clear documentation and communication about our engineering decisions
- **Accountability**: We take responsibility for our code and its impact on the broader system

## Code Review Standards

### Mandatory Code Review Policy

All code changes to production branches must undergo thorough review before merging. This policy ensures code quality, knowledge sharing, and risk mitigation across our engineering teams.

#### 1+ Reviewer Requirement

**Policy**: Every pull request (PR) must receive approval from at least one qualified reviewer before merging.

**Rationale**: This requirement mitigates the risk of undetected bugs, security vulnerabilities, and architectural issues by preventing single-person code approvals. No individual, regardless of experience level or position, should merge code without independent review.

**Implementation**:

- Configure GitHub branch protection rules to require at least one approving review
- Disable the ability for PR authors to approve their own changes
- Ensure reviewers have appropriate expertise in the relevant codebase areas

#### Multiple Reviewer Policy

**Policy**: For critical system components, security-sensitive code, and major feature implementations, a minimum of two independent reviewers must approve the changes.

**Rationale**: Multiple reviewers ensure:
- **Continuity**: Reduces dependency on single individuals for code review coverage
- **Quality Assurance**: Different perspectives catch issues that single reviewers might miss
- **Knowledge Distribution**: Spreads understanding of system changes across the team
- **Risk Mitigation**: Implements separation of duties as a safeguard against accidental or malicious changes
- **Bottleneck Prevention**: Prevents release delays caused by single reviewer unavailability

**Implementation**:
- Require two approving reviews for PRs affecting core algorithms, security features, or deployment infrastructure
- Maintain a diverse pool of qualified reviewers across different expertise areas
- Establish clear escalation paths when multiple reviewers are unavailable

### Review Guidelines

#### For Reviewers

**Technical Review Focus**:

- Verify code functionality and logic correctness
- Assess performance implications and resource usage
- Check for security vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors
- Evaluate code maintainability and readability
- Ensure compliance with established coding standards and architectural patterns

**Review Process**:

- Provide constructive, specific feedback with clear rationale
- Suggest improvements rather than just identifying problems
- Test critical changes locally when necessary
- Document any concerns or questions for future reference
- Approve only when confident the code meets our quality standards

#### For Authors

**Pre-Review Preparation**:

- Write comprehensive PR descriptions explaining the changes and their purpose
- Include relevant test cases and documentation updates
- Perform self-review to catch obvious issues before submission
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines pass successfully
- Break large changes into smaller, reviewable chunks when possible

**During Review**:

- Respond promptly to reviewer feedback and questions
- Provide additional context or clarification when requested
- Address all feedback before requesting re-review
- Maintain professional communication throughout the process

## Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The YOLO team follows a structured, security-focused SDLC framework that ensures consistent quality, security, and maintainability across all development phases. This framework is specifically tailored for computer vision and AI model development while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

### SDLC Framework Overview

Our SDLC consists of seven key phases, each with defined deliverables, security checkpoints, and quality gates:

## FAQ

### Why do we require multiple reviewers for code changes?

Multiple reviewers significantly improve code quality by bringing different perspectives and expertise to the review process. This practice helps catch bugs, security vulnerabilities, and design issues that single reviewers might miss. It also ensures knowledge distribution across the team and prevents bottlenecks when individual reviewers are unavailable.

### How do we handle urgent hotfixes that need immediate deployment?

Even for urgent fixes, we maintain our review standards with expedited timelines. Critical hotfixes require at least one reviewer, with the understanding that additional reviews may be conducted post-deployment. Emergency procedures should be documented and regularly tested to ensure rapid response capabilities.

### What happens if reviewers disagree on a code change?

When reviewers have conflicting opinions, the discussion should focus on technical merits and alignment with our engineering principles. If consensus cannot be reached, escalate to a senior engineer or architect for final decision. Document the rationale for future reference.

### How do we ensure reviewer expertise matches the code being reviewed?

Maintain a reviewer assignment matrix that matches engineer expertise with relevant codebase areas. Rotate reviewers to prevent knowledge silos while ensuring at least one reviewer has deep familiarity with the affected code. Provide training opportunities for reviewers to expand their expertise.

### What tools and resources support our engineering practices?

Our engineering practices are supported by:
- GitHub branch protection rules and review requirements
- Automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Code quality analysis tools and security scanners
- Documentation platforms and knowledge bases
- Monitoring and alerting systems for production environments
