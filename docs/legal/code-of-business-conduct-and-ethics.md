# Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (2025) üìñ

## About This Code üìå

Ultralytics operates globally through a hybrid model that combines remote work with shared office spaces across Europe, the UK, the US, and China. With team members working from diverse locations and cultures, we have created this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to make sure everyone understands their responsibilities and maintains our high standards.

Our mission is to move the world forward by first moving ourselves, continuously pushing the boundaries of AI through relentless execution, creating the world's best open-source solutions that benefit everyone equally, and empowering individuals to improve their lives and the lives of those around them.

We believe the way we work matters just as much as what we build. At Ultralytics, five core values guide everything we do: Relentless Progress, Strive for Excellence, Actions Not Words, Act with Urgency, and Open Access to All. These values shape our culture, inform our decisions, and define how we collaborate and innovate.

By staying true to this [Mission and Values](https://handbook.ultralytics.com/mission-vision-values/), we ensure that our pursuit of technological advancement is grounded in integrity, inclusivity, and purpose.

This Code establishes essential guidelines for ethical behavior and legal compliance. All team members, including employees (full-time or part-time), contractors, advisors, and partners worldwide, must adhere to this Code. While not comprehensive of all policies or laws, it provides minimum standards for conducting business responsibly. Everyone is expected to familiarize themselves with applicable laws and regulations in their area of operation.

Violations of applicable laws, company policies, or this Code can result in serious individual consequences, including disciplinary actions and dismissal. These violations also create significant risks for Ultralytics as a whole, potentially exposing the company to legal liability, reputational damage, and threats to our operational continuity.

We trust you to exercise sound judgment and maintain the highest ethical standards in all business decisions. When facing uncertainty or ethical dilemmas, we encourage you to seek guidance and raise concerns promptly. For assistance or to report concerns, contact legal@ultralytics.com. Additional information on how to report concerns can be found in the final section, [Raising Concerns and Getting Help](##raising-concerns-and-getting-help-‚òéÔ∏è).

## Creating an Inclusive and Safe Workplace üè°

### Our Commitment to Respect and Inclusion

Ultralytics is committed to fostering a culture where respect, fairness, and integrity are fundamental to everything we do. We provide a safe, inclusive, and positive environment for all team members, regardless of gender, race, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, age, or any other protected characteristic.

We prohibit discrimination, harassment, or bullying in any form. Every team member should feel valued, empowered, and safe to perform their best work. Harassment can take many forms, including unwelcome verbal or physical conduct, or repeated behavior that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

### Workplace Safety and Security

Everyone plays a role in maintaining a safe and secure workplace. We expect all team members to:

- Follow security protocols, including proper badge usage and facility access procedures defined by our workspace provider
- Report unsafe conditions, situations, or accidents immediately
- Report any acts of violence or threats toward persons or property without delay

### Substance Use Policy

Team members are expected to maintain a safe, professional, and respectful environment while working, representing Ultralytics, or participating in any company-related activities. The use, possession, or being under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol during work hours, whether at company facilities, remote settings, or company events, is strictly prohibited.

Participation in company social events is entirely voluntary. While alcohol may be served at such gatherings, we ask that you enjoy it responsibly. Maintaining respectful behavior and ensuring that everyone feels comfortable is a shared responsibility; we count on you to uphold these values.

## Fair Business Practices üíª

### Anti-Corruption and Bribery

Ultralytics is committed to complying with all anti-bribery laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Any form of bribery, direct or indirect, is strictly prohibited. You must not offer a bribe to, or accept one from, any person, at any time, for any reason.

Any third party, supplier, contractor, consultant, agent, or intermediary acting on behalf of Ultralytics is also prohibited from offering, giving, or accepting bribes. Cultural "norms" are never an excuse to make a bribe. When in doubt, consult the Legal Team before offering or receiving anything of value.

### Gifts and Business Entertainment

We build relationships through professional excellence, not through excessive gifts or entertainment. Accept or offer only promotional items or gifts of nominal value. Business meals and entertainment must be reasonable, infrequent, and directly related to legitimate business purposes.

Document and disclose any gifts or entertainment that could appear to influence business decisions to the Legal Team. Report situations that make you uncomfortable or seem inappropriate.

### Fair Competition

Competition laws worldwide ensure healthy markets by preventing practices that harm fair competition and consumer choice. These regulations prohibit competitors from coordinating on pricing, sales terms, or dividing customers and markets between them.

Ultralytics competes solely on the quality and value of our products and services, never through anticompetitive behavior or misleading practices. We maintain strict compliance with competition laws in all markets where we operate.

Contact Legal Team immediately if you have questions about competition law requirements or suspect any violations by Ultralytics, partners, suppliers, or competitors.

### Business Partner Selection

When engaging business partners, consider how they align with our values and conduct their businesses. Who we do business with directly impacts our reputation and may have legal and business implications.

Conduct appropriate due diligence and only select parties you trust to represent Ultralytics well and share our commitment to ethical conduct. Be alert to red flags such as vague service descriptions, unusual payment requests, reluctance to provide compliance certifications, or a history of illegal or questionable conduct.

### Government and Public Sector Dealings

When Ultralytics conducts business with government entities, state-owned enterprises, or public international organizations, we must comply with strict anti-corruption laws. Under statutes like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, providing anything of value to government officials to secure business or favorable treatment constitutes a criminal offense.

Government officials include elected officials, candidates for public office, employees of government-owned companies, representatives of public international organizations, and political party members. The prohibition extends beyond traditional gifts to include meals, entertainment, travel expenses, political or charitable donations, and employment opportunities for officials' family members.

In limited circumstances, with proper pre-approval, modest expenditures may be permissible when directly related to legitimate product demonstrations or service presentations. For example, a reasonable meal during a day-long product demonstration may be acceptable with advance authorization.

Before offering any form of hospitality or benefit to government officials, consult with the Legal Team and your supervisor to ensure full compliance.

### Insider Trading Prevention

If you learn material, nonpublic information about Ultralytics or any other company (such as customers, suppliers, or parties in potential transactions), you may not trade securities or "tip" others who might make investment decisions based on such information.

Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would consider it important in making trading decisions, and "nonpublic" if it hasn't been disseminated to investors generally. Trading on inside information is illegal and unethical, regardless of the trade size.

## Conflict of interests üë•

A conflict of interest occurs when your interests, whether financial, professional, or relational, could interfere with your ability to act in Ultralytics' best interests. These situations can compromise your objectivity and decision-making, potentially harming the company's reputation and business outcomes. Even the appearance of a conflict can undermine trust and credibility.

Identifying conflicts of interest can be challenging and isn't always straightforward. When you're uncertain whether a situation constitutes a conflict, always seek guidance from the Legal Team and copy your manager.

### Outside Work and Activities

We respect that you have responsibilities and interests outside of work. However, you must avoid situations where outside employment, consulting, or board service could interfere with your professional judgment or responsibilities to Ultralytics.

You may not work for competitors or participate in activities that enhance a competitor's position. Other outside work is generally permitted if it doesn't create conflicts or impact your performance. Discuss any outside employment or board service with the Legal Team and obtain approval before proceeding.

### Personal Relationships in Business

Personal relationships with colleagues create conflicts of interest when one person reports to the other or has decision-making authority that could affect the other's employment, compensation, or career advancement. Similarly, relationships with individuals at companies we do business with may compromise your objectivity.

If you have personal relationships that could affect business decisions, disclose them immediately to the Legal Team and remove yourself from related decision-making processes. This includes situations involving family members or significant others.

### Financial Interests and Business Dealings

You may not have personal or family financial interests in Ultralytics customers, partners, suppliers, or competitors that could improperly influence your judgment or create divided loyalty. This includes investment, ownership, or creditor interests that might result in personal benefit from your role at Ultralytics.

Multiple factors determine whether a conflict exists, including the investment size, your ability to influence decisions, access to confidential information, and any personal connections you may have with the other party. When conducting business with family, friends, or close personal contacts, disclosure to the Legal Team is required.

## Protecting Data at Ultralytics üîê

As a leader in AI and computer vision technology, Ultralytics is entrusted with sensitive data from our customers, partners, employees, and the broader community who rely on our open-source and commercial solutions. Each team member has a fundamental responsibility to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data we handle.

We are committed to processing and protecting data according to applicable privacy and security requirements, regulations, and industry best practices worldwide. Our approach to data protection is built on transparency, accountability, and trust, recognizing that securing data is everyone's business.

### Ultralytics Confidential Information

Confidential Information generated and gathered in Ultralytics' business plays a vital role in our operations, competitive position, and ability to innovate in the AI industry. "Confidential Information" encompasses any material that Ultralytics does not make or want to make publicly known at a given time.

At a minimum, this information includes technical or scientific information about current and future AI services or research, non-public product roadmaps, customer data, usage analytics, business or marketing plans, financial data, personnel information, customer lists, and other non-public information that could benefit competitors or harm Ultralytics if disclosed.

You are expected to protect Ultralytics' Confidential Information and any trade secrets to which you may have access during your work, as outlined in your employment agreement and/or non-disclosure agreement. This responsibility applies while you work at Ultralytics and continues even after you leave the company.

Read our [Data Classification Policy](https://app.vanta.com/c/ultralytics/employee/onboarding) to learn more about how different types of information should be handled.

### Handling Confidential Information

Confidential Information should be used solely for legitimate company purposes and shared only with authorized personnel who have a business need to know. You may not disclose or distribute Ultralytics' Confidential Information, except when disclosure is authorized by the company or required by applicable law, regulation, or legal orders (such as court orders, subpoenas, or government investigations).

All team members must complete mandatory security and privacy training through Vanta upon joining the company and then annually thereafter. When your engagement with Ultralytics ends, you must return all company Confidential Information and proprietary materials.

### Third Party Confidential Information

Just as Ultralytics protects its confidential materials, we respect the rights of other people and companies to protect their Confidential Information and trade secrets. If you have information that might reasonably be considered Confidential Information or a trade secret of another person or company, you must not reveal it to Ultralytics without authorization from the owner of the information. This includes information from prior employers.

You may, under an authorized non-disclosure agreement, become aware of another company's Confidential Information or trade secrets in the context of exploring business relationships, partnerships, or integrations. You must respect the proprietary nature of this information and not use it or disclose it without proper authorization.

### Incident Reporting and Support

All security incidents must be reported immediately to security@ultralytics.com or [#compliance](https://ultralytics-work.slack.com/archives/C08EBUT9UCR) Slack channel. An incident includes any situation where protected data can be lost, stolen, compromised, or otherwise improperly handled, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.

## Financial Responsibility at Ultralytics üí≥

Stakeholders depend on accurate financial information to make informed decisions about Ultralytics. All financial transactions require proper authorization and must comply with company policies. We are committed to honest, accurate recording and reporting of all financial data while maintaining strong internal controls and following applicable laws and regulations.

### Responsible Business Expenses

Exercise good judgment when spending company money. All expenses must be reasonable, business-related, properly documented, and compliant with [Ultralytics Finance Handbook](https://handbook.ultralytics.com/finance/#employee-credit-cards). Submit expense reports promptly with clear business justification and complete details. When uncertain about expenditures, consult your manager first.

Managers must review and approve all team member expenses, carefully examining both costs and supporting documentation before approval.

### Ethical Procurement Practices

When purchasing goods, services, or software tools for Ultralytics, act with integrity and obtain proper authorization before engaging vendors or suppliers. Make decisions based on business value and merit, not personal relationships or incentives. Ensure all purchases serve legitimate business purposes and maintain transparency in vendor selection and pricing decisions.

### Honest Revenue Recording

Record all sales transactions accurately and completely, reflecting the true nature of business agreements. Never manipulate or misrepresent revenue timing or amounts to meet targets or expectations. Ensure all sales have genuine customer commitments before recording revenue, and report any questionable transactions or pressure to inappropriately record sales.

### Enhanced Responsibilities

Our CEO, Finance, and Legal Teams carry heightened obligations to maintain organizational integrity and serve stakeholders effectively. These roles must foster a company-wide culture of accurate, comprehensive, and timely financial reporting. Key responsibilities include:

- Maintaining honesty and integrity while avoiding conflicts of interest
- Ensuring all information provided for stakeholder communications is complete, accurate, and timely
- Staying current with relevant laws and regulations, seeking legal guidance when needed
- Immediately reporting suspected violations to the Legal Team
- Championing adherence to this Code throughout the organization

### Preventing Money Laundering

Ultralytics strictly complies with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws globally. Money laundering involves concealing illegal funds or making them appear legitimate. Watch for and report suspicious payment activities, including:

- Large cash payment attempts
- Payments involving parties not in the contract
- Payment requests exceeding contract amounts
- Payments in unauthorized currencies
- Payments from suspicious or non-business accounts

## Responsible Use of Ultralytics Resources üõ†Ô∏è

Ultralytics provides a range of tools and resources, such as office space, computers, software, internet access, and supplies. These are here to support our shared goals and your day-to-day work. We expect everyone to use them responsibly and in ways that benefit the company, while maintaining professionalism and security.

### Equipment Protection and Accountability

If you're using Ultralytics equipment at home or while traveling, take steps to keep it safe from damage, theft, or unauthorized use. Please treat it with the same care you'd give your personal belongings. When your time with Ultralytics ends, you must return all company resources in good working order. If anything gets damaged beyond regular wear and tear, let your manager know as soon as possible.

### Personal Use Guidelines

We understand that sometimes you might need to use company resources for personal reasons. Keep the personal use occasional and make sure it doesn‚Äôt interfere with your work, impact team performance, or conflict with company interests. Personal use should always be reasonable and maintain a professional work environment.

### Prohibited Activities

There are certain things you shouldn‚Äôt do with Ultralytics resources. You‚Äôre not allowed to take or use company property without approval, use it for personal business ventures or consulting work, or run fundraising efforts unless you have authorization from the Legal Team.

### Software Licensing and Intellectual Property

Ultralytics respects intellectual property rights and software licensing seriously, and we expect everyone to do the same. Only use software that‚Äôs been properly licensed or approved, whether it‚Äôs commercial or open source. Using unauthorized software is illegal for both you and the company. If you're unsure about licensing for any tools you need, raise your question in the [#it-support](https://ultralytics-work.slack.com/archives/C099NHUEHD1) channel.

### Copyright and Protected Materials

Photos, videos, music, articles, white papers, and websites are usually protected by copyright, even if they‚Äôre online and easy to access. If you want to include this kind of content in a presentation, event, or marketing material, make sure you have the right permissions. If you're unsure, contact the [#it-support](https://ultralytics-work.slack.com/archives/C099NHUEHD1) channel for help. Our team can guide you to approved visual asset libraries within our authorised tools.

### Privacy and Monitoring

At Ultralytics, we respect your privacy, but it's important to understand that the resources we provide for work, such as email, messaging platforms, devices, and network access, are company property. This includes personal devices if you use them for work purposes.

To keep our systems secure, ensure productivity, and protect sensitive information, Ultralytics may, as permitted by applicable laws, monitor or access information created, stored, transmitted, or accessed through company tools and systems. This could include emails, files, internet activity, or messages exchanged via work platforms.

Monitoring is done only when needed for legitimate business reasons such as security checks, compliance reviews, or to investigate potential misuse. We don‚Äôt monitor without cause, and we aim to be transparent about how we handle digital tools and data. To support these monitoring objectives, we deploy a mobile device management (MDM) solution to all devices that access company systems and data. For more details, refer to our approved [Hardware Policy](https://handbook.ultralytics.com/tools/hardware/).

## Raising Concerns and Getting Help ‚òéÔ∏è

Living up to our Code of Conduct is something we all share. If something doesn‚Äôt seem right, you‚Äôre encouraged and expected to speak up. Whether it‚Äôs a potential breach of our values, a legal concern, or just something that feels ethically questionable, raising it early helps prevent bigger issues and shows our commitment to integrity and trust.

### Safe to Raise a Concern

We want everyone to feel confident and safe bringing concerns forward. Ultralytics doesn‚Äôt tolerate retaliation of any kind against anyone who, in good faith, asks a question, raises an issue, or takes part in an investigation. Retaliating against someone for speaking up is a serious violation and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

### How to Raise Concerns

The first and often best step is to speak with your manager. They're usually well-positioned to help with questions or concerns and may be able to resolve the issue right away. If you're uncomfortable speaking with your manager, or if your concern hasn‚Äôt been addressed to your satisfaction, you can also contact the Legal Team at legal@ultralytics.com.

### Anonymous Reporting

If you prefer to raise a concern without sharing your name, Ultralytics offers a secure and anonymous reporting option through Google Forms. We understand that speaking up can be uncomfortable, and this anonymous channel provides you with a safe, confidential space to report any issues.

That said, if you feel comfortable, we do encourage you to identify yourself when submitting a report. Providing your name can help us investigate the matter more efficiently, follow up quickly if we need more information, and take meaningful corrective action when necessary. But if you‚Äôd rather stay anonymous, that‚Äôs entirely your choice - we respect that and will support it to the extent allowed by local laws.

Please keep in mind that the more detail you can share in your report, the better we‚Äôll be able to understand and investigate the issue. Anonymous reports without enough context may limit our ability to take appropriate action.

### What Happens After You Report

Once a concern is reported, it will be reviewed and investigated by trained team members. To keep things fair and unbiased, we ask that you don‚Äôt conduct your own investigation. Our goal is to handle every issue respectfully, professionally, and with the seriousness it deserves.

### Consequences of Violations

Violations of our Code or any laws or regulations can lead to disciplinary actions. These will depend on the nature and seriousness of the situation and may include formal warnings, demotion, or dismissal. In some cases, legal consequences may also apply.
