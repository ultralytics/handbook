- **Add tests**: Include tests for new features
- **Update docs**: Keep [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) current

### Coding Standards üìê

- **Docstrings**: Use [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with types in parentheses
- **Line width**: 120 characters maximum
- **Imports**: Use `pathlib` instead of `os`
- **Testing**: All PRs must pass [CI tests](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/)

## License Information üìú

### AGPL-3.0 License

Ultralytics uses [AGPL-3.0](https://www.ultralytics.com/legal/agpl-3-0-software-license) for repositories. This promotes openness, transparency, and collaborative improvement.

### Using YOLO in Your Project

If you use Ultralytics YOLO models or code in your project, AGPL-3.0 requires your entire derivative work also be open-sourced under AGPL-3.0.

**Why compliance matters:**

- Keeps software open for community benefit
- Legal requirement when using AGPL-3.0 code
- Fosters collaboration and transparency

**Alternative:** If you prefer not to open-source your project, obtain an [Enterprise License](https://www.ultralytics.com/license).

### How to Comply with AGPL-3.0

Make complete source code publicly available under AGPL-3.0:

1. **Choose starting point**:
    - Fork [Ultralytics YOLO repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
    - Use [Ultralytics template repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/template)

2. **License your project**:
    - Add `LICENSE` file with full [AGPL-3.0 text](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3)
    - Add license notice at top of source files

3. **Publish source code** including:
    - Complete application/system
    - Modifications to Ultralytics code
    - Training/validation/inference scripts
    - Model weights if modified
    - Configuration files
    - Backend/frontend code
    - Third-party libraries modified
    - Training data if redistributable

4. **Document clearly**:
    - State AGPL-3.0 license in `README.md`
    - Include setup instructions
    - Attribute Ultralytics YOLO appropriately

See [Ultralytics Template Repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/template) for example structure.
