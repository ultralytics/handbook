## Contributing Guidelines üìã

### Code of Conduct ü§ù

All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/code-of-conduct/), which is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). This ensures a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. **Respect**, **kindness**, and **professionalism** are at the heart of our community.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA) üìù

Before we can merge your PR, you must sign our [CLA](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CLA/). This legal agreement ensures contributions are properly licensed under [AGPL-3.0](https://www.ultralytics.com/legal/agpl-3-0-software-license), protecting both you and the project.

After submitting your PR, the CLA bot will guide you. To sign, comment:

```
I have read the CLA Document and I sign the CLA
```

The CLA covers:

- Copyright and patent licenses for your contributions
- Rights for Ultralytics to use and distribute your work
- Representations that you own the rights to your contributions
- Disclaimer of warranties

Review the full [CLA document](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CLA/) for complete terms.

### Best Practices ‚ú®

When contributing code:

- **Avoid duplication**: Reuse existing code where possible
- **Make smaller changes**: Focused modifications over large-scale changes
- **Simplify**: Look for simplification opportunities
- **Consider compatibility**: Avoid breaking existing code
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow [Ruff Formatter](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
- **Add tests**: Include tests for new features
- **Update docs**: Keep [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) current

### Coding Standards üìê

- **Docstrings**: Use [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with types in parentheses
- **Line width**: 120 characters maximum
- **Imports**: Use `pathlib` instead of `os`
- **Testing**: All PRs must pass [CI tests](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/)
- **Type hints**: Use where beneficial

See [Development Workflow](../workflows/development.md) for complete coding standards.

## Ways to Contribute üåü

### Code Contributions üíª

- New features and enhancements for [YOLO models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/)
- Bug fixes and issue resolution
- Performance optimizations for [training](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) and [inference](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/)
- Export format support for various [deployment options](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-deployment-options/)
- Platform compatibility improvements

### Documentation üìö

- Improve existing [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- Add [tutorials and guides](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/) for specific use cases
- Fix typos and errors
- Translate documentation to other languages

### Testing üß™

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test new features across different [models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) and [tasks](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/)
- Report test coverage gaps
- Performance [benchmarking](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/benchmark/) across platforms

### Community Support üí¨

- Answer questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/discussions)
- Help users on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ultralytics)
- Review pull requests
- Triage issues

## Reporting Bugs üêû

Help us improve by reporting bugs via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues):

### Bug Report Requirements

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create [Minimum Reproducible Example (MRE)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum-reproducible-example/)** - Small, self-contained code that reproduces the issue
3. **Describe environment**: OS, Python version, library versions, hardware (CPU/GPU)
4. **Explain expected vs actual behavior** with error messages and tracebacks

### What Makes a Good MRE

A Minimum Reproducible Example should:

- **Isolate the problem**: Remove unnecessary code
- **Use public models and datasets**: e.g., `yolov8n.pt` and `coco8.yaml`
- **Include dependencies**: List with `yolo checks` or `pip list`
- **Provide clear description**: Expected vs actual behavior
- **Format properly**: Use code blocks with triple backticks
- **Be testable**: Others can run it without modifications

See the complete [MRE Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum-reproducible-example/) for detailed instructions.

## Reviewing Pull Requests üëÄ

Reviewing PRs is valuable contribution:

- **Check unit tests**: Verify tests for new features
- **Review documentation**: Ensure docs are updated
- **Evaluate performance**: Consider impact on speed/memory
- **Verify CI tests**: Confirm all tests pass
- **Provide constructive feedback**: Be specific and helpful
- **Recognize effort**: Thank contributors

## License Information üìú

### AGPL-3.0 License

Ultralytics uses [AGPL-3.0](https://www.ultralytics.com/legal/agpl-3-0-software-license) for repositories. This promotes openness, transparency, and collaborative improvement.

### Using YOLO in Your Project

If you use [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) models or code in your project, AGPL-3.0 requires your entire derivative work also be open-sourced under AGPL-3.0.

**Why compliance matters:**

- Keeps software open for community benefit
- Legal requirement when using AGPL-3.0 code
- Fosters collaboration and transparency

**Alternative:** If you prefer not to open-source your project, obtain an [Enterprise License](https://www.ultralytics.com/license).

### How to Comply with AGPL-3.0

Make complete source code publicly available under AGPL-3.0:

1. **Choose starting point**:
    - Fork [Ultralytics YOLO repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
    - Use [Ultralytics template repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/template)

2. **License your project**:
    - Add `LICENSE` file with full [AGPL-3.0 text](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3)
    - Add license notice at top of source files

3. **Publish source code** including:
    - Complete application/system
    - Modifications to Ultralytics code
    - [Training](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/)/[validation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/val/)/[inference](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/) scripts
    - Model weights if modified
    - Configuration files and [datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/) used
    - Backend/frontend code
    - Third-party libraries modified
    - Training data if redistributable

4. **Document clearly**:
    - State AGPL-3.0 license in `README.md`
    - Include setup instructions
    - Attribute Ultralytics YOLO appropriately

See [Ultralytics Template Repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/template) for example structure.
