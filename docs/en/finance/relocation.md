# Ultralytics Employee Relocation Policy üìç

## 1. Purpose and Scope üìå

This policy applies to full-time employees approved for relocation to our London, Madrid, or Shenzhen offices. All relocations require pre-approval from management and HR.

> **Note**: Existing remote team members are not required to relocate. This policy is for voluntary relocations or strategic moves initiated by management.

## 2. Eligibility Requirements ‚úÖ

Relocation assistance is reserved for employees who meet the following criteria:

- **Role:** Senior positions such as engineering leads, department heads, key technical contributors, or other strategic roles.
- **Performance:** Consistently meeting or exceeding performance expectations.
- **Tenure:** A minimum of six months of employment. This may be waived for strategic new hires or critical roles.
- **Business Need:** The relocation must be initiated by management for business-critical reasons or be a move that directly aligns with company strategic goals.

## 3. Approved Office Locations üåé

Relocation reimbursement is only available for moves to:

- **Madrid** (Europe)
- **London** (Europe)
- **Shenzhen** (Asia-Pacific)

!!! warning "Other Locations"

    Moves to cities not on this list are not eligible for reimbursement.

## 4. Relocation Compensation üí∞

### Standard Reimbursement

Eligible employees will receive a **one-time, flat-rate payment of $6,000 USD**.

- **Coverage:** This payment is intended to cover all associated moving expenses, including but not limited to travel, shipping of personal belongings, and temporary accommodation.
- **Payment:** The reimbursement is processed as a lump sum in the first payroll cycle after the relocation is complete and the new address is confirmed.

### Non-Reimbursable Costs

The following situations are not covered by this policy:

- Relocations to non-hub cities.
- Self-initiated moves without a clear, pre-approved business justification.
- Temporary relocations (less than 12 months).
- Lateral moves that do not serve a strategic business purpose.

## 5. Approval Process üîÑ

1.  **Request Submission:** An employee's direct manager must submit a relocation request, including a strong business justification.
2.  **Management Review:** The request is reviewed by senior management. Approval is typically granted within 10 business days.
3.  **Confirmation:** Once approved, HR will provide a written confirmation and a formal relocation agreement to the employee.

!!! note "Documentation"

    The business case should include the employee's role, the strategic importance of the move, and a proposed timeline.

## 6. Employee Obligations ‚öñÔ∏è

### Tenure Commitment

- Employees who receive relocation assistance must remain employed with Ultralytics for a **minimum of 18 months** following their relocation date.
- **Repayment Clause:** If the employee voluntarily resigns before the 18-month period is complete, they will be required to repay the **full** relocation reimbursement amount.

### Documentation

- Employees must provide proof of their new residence in the hub city to finalize the process.
- While receipts for individual expenses are not required for the flat-rate reimbursement, it is wise to maintain records for personal tax purposes.

## 7. Important Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Tax Implications

The $6,000 relocation payment is considered a taxable benefit and will be subject to applicable income taxes. Employees are responsible for their own personal tax obligations and are encouraged to consult with a tax advisor.

### Onsite Work Requirements

All employees work onsite 5 days per week at their office location. Relocated employees must work full-time from their new office and comply with local office policies.

## 8. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy will be considered on a case-by-case basis for business-critical needs, such as strategic new hires or unforeseen operational requirements. All exceptions require written approval from senior management.
