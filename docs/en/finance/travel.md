### Methodology 📚

Ultralytics bases daily per diem rates on official U.S. government sources, adjusted to reflect our company’s size and budget considerations. Rates are derived from the U.S. [General Services Administration (GSA)](https://www.gsa.gov/) for travel within the Continental United States (CONUS) and the U.S. [Department of State](https://www.state.gov/) for travel outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS).
