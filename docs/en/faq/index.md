# Frequently Asked Questions üí¨

## Finance & Expenses üí∞

**How do I submit expenses?**

For expenses under $3,000, pay personally and submit receipts for reimbursement. For expenses $3,000+, submit a request with cost estimate for approval before purchasing. See [Finance Handbook](../finance/index.md) for details.

**How long does reimbursement take?**

Typically 7 business days after submission and approval. Submit expenses within the same fiscal quarter when possible.

Per diem covers all meals, ground transportation, and incidental expenses. Only airfare is reimbursable separately. See [Travel Policy](../finance/travel.md) for rates by city.
