# What to Expect: Security & Compliance Requirements for Employees

Welcome to Ultralytics! This guide explains what you can expect regarding security and compliance requirements during your journey with us.

## Before You Start

### Background Checks
We conduct standard background verification for all new team members as required by local law. This is a standard part of our hiring process and helps protect everyone on our team.

### Security and Employment Agreements

* **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):** Protects our confidential information  
* **Employment/Contractor Agreement:** References our Code of Business Conduct, which outlines our values, compliance expectations, and security practices  
* **Policy Acknowledgment:** You'll formally acknowledge your security responsibilities through Vanta, our compliance management system  

## Required Training

All new team members complete these training modules during onboarding to gain practical knowledge for their role:

* **CCPA Training:** California privacy law basics  
* **GDPR Training:** European data protection requirements  
* **General Security Awareness:** Best practices for keeping our data and systems safe  
* **Secure Code Training:** Identifying and preventing security vulnerabilities using OWASP standards (YOLO and PLATFORM teams only)  

## Ongoing Expectations

### Annual Training
You'll complete annual refresher training to stay up-to-date on security practices and regulatory requirements. We'll send reminders when training is due, and our Security & Compliance Team monitors completion to ensure every team remains compliant.

### Performance Reviews
Your regular performance reviews will include assessment of:  
* Job performance and role competence  
* Adherence to company policies and code of conduct  
* Achievement of your specific role objectives  

### Staying Informed
Security regulations and threats evolve constantly. We'll keep you updated through email, Slack, team meetings, and training updates so you're always aware of new requirements and emerging risks. 

## When Employment Ends

### Access and Equipment
* All system access will be revoked on your agreed termination date  
* Return all company equipment promptly after your last day
* Ultralytics will coordinate pickup or shipping logistics with you

### Termination Agreement
You'll be asked to sign a termination agreement that clarifies any ongoing obligations, such as confidentiality requirements that continue beyond your employment. This agreement helps ensure a clear understanding of expectations for both parties after your departure.
