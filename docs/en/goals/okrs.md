# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

## What are OKRs?

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are our goal-setting framework for aligning teams and measuring progress:

- **Objectives**: Qualitative goals describing what we want to achieve
- **Key Results**: Quantitative metrics measuring progress toward objectives

## OKR Structure

### Company OKRs
Set by leadership, defining strategic priorities for the quarter/year. Company OKRs cascade to teams and individuals.

### Team OKRs
Each team develops OKRs aligned with company objectives, focusing on their domain's contribution to overall goals.

### Individual OKRs
Team members set personal OKRs in collaboration with their managers, supporting team and company objectives.

## OKR Cycle

**Quarterly Cadence**:
1. **Planning** (Week 1): Set OKRs for upcoming quarter
2. **Execution** (Weeks 2-12): Track progress, weekly check-ins
3. **Review** (Week 13): Grade OKRs, analyze outcomes
4. **Retrospective**: Learn and adjust for next quarter

**Annual Strategy**:
- Company-level goals inform quarterly OKRs
- Year-end review evaluates annual progress
- Strategic planning for next year

## OKR Best Practices

### Setting Effective OKRs
- **Ambitious**: Target 70-80% achievement (not 100%)
- **Measurable**: Clear numeric targets or binary outcomes
- **Time-bound**: Specific deadlines within the quarter
- **Aligned**: Support higher-level objectives
- **Focused**: 3-5 objectives per level maximum

### Grading Scale
- **0.0-0.3**: Missed target significantly
- **0.4-0.6**: Made progress but fell short
- **0.7-0.9**: Achieved or nearly achieved (success)
- **1.0**: Exceeded expectations (may need more ambitious targets)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Setting too many OKRs (focus on critical few)
- Making objectives too easy (not aspirational enough)
- Treating OKRs as task lists (focus on outcomes)
- Skipping regular check-ins (track progress weekly)

## Transparency & Visibility

All OKRs are visible across the organization:
- Company OKRs shared with entire team
- Team OKRs accessible to all employees
- Regular updates in team meetings
- Dashboards track real-time progress

## Tools & Resources

OKRs are managed through:
- Quarterly planning sessions
- Weekly team standups
- Progress tracking dashboards
- Leadership review meetings
