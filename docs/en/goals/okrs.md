# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

## What are OKRs?

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are our goal-setting framework for aligning teams and measuring progress. Used by Google, Intel, and leading startups, OKRs help us focus on what matters most:

- **Objectives**: Qualitative, ambitious goals describing what we want to achieve
- **Key Results**: 3-5 quantitative, time-bound metrics measuring progress toward objectives
- **Initiatives**: The specific projects and tasks we'll execute to achieve key results

## OKR Structure

### Company OKRs

Set by leadership, defining strategic priorities for the quarter/year. Company OKRs cascade to teams and individuals.

### Team OKRs

Each team develops OKRs aligned with company objectives, focusing on their domain's contribution to overall goals.

### Individual OKRs

Team members set personal OKRs in collaboration with their managers, supporting team and company objectives.

## OKR Cycle

**Quarterly Cadence**:

1. **Planning** (Week 1): Set OKRs for upcoming quarter
2. **Execution** (Weeks 2-12): Track progress, weekly check-ins
3. **Review** (Week 13): Grade OKRs, analyze outcomes
4. **Retrospective**: Learn and adjust for next quarter

**Annual Strategy**:

- Company-level goals inform quarterly OKRs
- Year-end review evaluates annual progress
- Strategic planning for next year

## OKR Best Practices

### Setting Effective OKRs

- **Ambitious but Achievable**: Target 70-80% achievement rate (not 100% - if hitting 100%, OKRs weren't ambitious enough)
- **Measurable**: Clear numeric targets (e.g., "Increase PyPI downloads from 500K to 1M/month") or binary outcomes
- **Time-bound**: Specific deadlines within the quarter (typically 13 weeks)
- **Aligned**: Cascade from company → team → individual goals
- **Focused**: 3-5 objectives per level maximum, with 3-5 key results each
- **Inspiring**: Everyone should understand why the OKR matters
- **Transparent**: All OKRs visible company-wide for cross-functional alignment

### Grading Scale

- **0.0-0.3**: Missed target significantly
- **0.4-0.6**: Made progress but fell short
- **0.7-0.9**: Achieved or nearly achieved (success)
- **1.0**: Exceeded expectations (may need more ambitious targets)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too Many OKRs**: More than 5 objectives dilutes focus - prioritize ruthlessly
- **Sandbagging**: Setting easily achievable targets to guarantee success
- **Task Lists**: Confusing OKRs with project plans ("Launch feature X" vs "Increase user engagement by 50%")
- **Infrequent Check-ins**: Waiting until quarter-end to review progress
- **Lack of Ownership**: OKRs without clear owners and accountability
- **No Mid-Quarter Adjustments**: Being too rigid when priorities shift
- **Treating OKRs as Performance Reviews**: OKRs measure team progress, not individual performance

## Transparency & Visibility

OKRs are fully transparent across Ultralytics:

- **Company OKRs**: Shared all-hands, posted in Slack, reviewed monthly
- **Team OKRs**: Accessible in shared workspace (Notion/Linear), discussed in standups
- **Individual OKRs**: Discussed in 1:1s, aligned with team objectives
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Live dashboards show progress toward key results
- **Public Metrics**: Community-facing metrics (GitHub stars, PyPI downloads) shared openly

Transparency drives accountability and enables cross-functional collaboration.

## Tools & Resources

OKRs are managed through:

- Quarterly planning sessions
- Weekly team standups
- Progress tracking dashboards
- Leadership review meetings
