# Career Progression Framework

Ultralytics' career framework provides clear expectations for each level and guides professional development. We maintain two career tracks—Individual Contributor (IC) and Management—allowing team members to advance based on their strengths and interests.

!!! info "Equal Value"

    Both IC and Management tracks are valued equally and offer equivalent compensation and growth potential at similar scope levels. Choose the track that best aligns with your strengths and career goals.

## Career Tracks

**Individual Contributor (IC)**: IC02 → IC03 → IC04 → IC05 → IC06 → IC07  
**Management**: M04 → M05 → M06 → M07 → M08

**Track switching**: IC04/IC05 ↔ M04 | M04/M05 ↔ IC05/IC06

## Switching Career Tracks

Track switches are normal and supported—discuss with your manager during quarterly reviews.

| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IC → Management** | IC04/IC05→M04 | Technical excellence + leadership examples (mentoring, project leadership) + manager endorsement + 12+ months |
| **Management → IC** | M04/M05→IC05+ | Maintain technical currency + manager discussion + business need + smooth team transition                     |

**When to switch IC→Management**: Passionate about people development, organizational dynamics, influencing through teams  
**When to switch Management→IC**: Miss hands-on technical work, prefer expertise-based influence, want deeper specialization

## Promotion Process

Promotions require **sustained demonstration** of next-level performance across all dimensions:

1. **Performance** - Meeting/exceeding current level for 6+ months
2. **Next-Level Work** - Consistently operating at next level for 6-12 months
3. **Scope** - Expanded scope and complexity appropriate to next level
4. **Impact** - Demonstrated impact on team, function, or company
5. **Readiness** - Manager and skip-level agreement

    Document wins continuously • Seek feedback regularly • Proactively take next-level work • Build visibility through demos and docs • Be patient—promotions reward sustained performance

## Compensation

Compensation reflects scope, impact, and market rates—not tenure. Both tracks offer equivalent pay at similar scope levels.

**Leveling factors**: Geographic location • Role specialization (ML/AI, Security) • Performance • Prior experience

!!! info "Reviews"
