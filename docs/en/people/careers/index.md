# Career Progression Framework

Ultralytics' career framework provides clear expectations for each level and guides professional development. We maintain two career tracks—Individual Contributor (IC) and Management—allowing team members to advance based on their strengths and interests.

## Career Tracks Overview

### Individual Contributor (IC) Track

Focused on technical excellence, problem-solving, and individual impact. IC roles advance through deepening expertise and expanding scope of influence without managing people.

**Progression**: IC02 (Associate/Junior) → IC03 (Professional) → IC04 (Senior) → IC05 (Staff) → IC06 (Senior Staff) → IC07 (Principal)

**See detailed expectations**: [IC Levels (IC02-IC07)](levels-ic.md)

### Management Track

Focused on achieving results through others, building teams, and organizational leadership. Management roles balance people leadership with technical or domain expertise.

**Progression**: M04 (Lead Manager) → M05 (Manager) → M06 (Senior Manager) → M07 (Head of) → M08 (Director/VP)

**See detailed expectations**: [Management Levels (M04-M08)](levels-management.md)

!!! info "Equal Value"

    Both IC and Management tracks are valued equally and offer equivalent compensation and growth potential at similar scope levels. Choose the track that best aligns with your strengths and career goals.

## Switching Career Tracks

Team members can move between IC and Management tracks based on interests, strengths, and business needs. This flexibility allows everyone to find their optimal contribution path.

### IC to Management

**When to Consider**:

- Passionate about developing people and building teams
- Enjoy navigating organizational dynamics and stakeholder management
- Want to influence through others' work rather than individual contributions
- Strong leadership and communication skills

**Typical Path**: IC04/IC05 → M04 (often with mentor/shadow period)

**Requirements**:

- Demonstrated technical excellence at current level
- Leadership examples: mentoring, project leadership, cross-team collaboration
- Manager endorsement and leadership interest discussion
- 12+ months in current role
- Business need for management position

### Management to IC

**When to Consider**:

- Miss hands-on technical work and individual contribution
- Prefer influence through expertise rather than organizational authority
- Want deeper specialization in technical domain
- Enjoy solving complex problems directly

**Typical Path**: M04/M05 → IC05/IC06 (depending on tenure and expertise)

**Requirements**:

- Maintain technical currency alongside management responsibilities
- Discussed with manager as part of career planning
- Business need and appropriate IC role available
- Smooth team transition plan

!!! note "Track Switching Support"

    Career track changes are normal and supported. Discuss with your manager during quarterly reviews. We value both paths equally and compensate based on scope and impact, not track choice.
