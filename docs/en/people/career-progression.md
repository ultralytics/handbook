# Career Progression 📈

This guide defines Ultralytics' career framework, providing clear expectations for each level and guiding promotion decisions. We maintain two career tracks: Individual Contributor (IC) and Management, allowing team members to advance based on their strengths and interests.

## Career Tracks Overview

### Individual Contributor (IC) Track

**Levels**: IC2 (Junior) → IC3 (Professional) → IC4 (Senior) → IC5 (Staff) → IC6 (Principal) → IC7 (Senior Principal)

### Management Track

Focused on achieving results through others, building teams, and organizational leadership. Management roles balance people leadership with technical or domain expertise.

**Levels**: M4 (Lead Manager) → M5 (Senior Manager) → M6 (Head of/Director) → M7 (VP)

## How to Use This Guide

- **Self-assessment**: Understand your current level and growth areas
- **Goal-setting**: Identify skills needed for next level during quarterly reviews
- **Promotion decisions**: Managers and HR use these criteria to evaluate readiness
- **Career planning**: Explore both IC and Management paths to find your fit

!!! note "Promotion Timing"

    Promotions typically require 12-18 months demonstrating next-level performance consistently. Exceptional contributions may accelerate this timeline. Discuss readiness with your manager during quarterly reviews.
