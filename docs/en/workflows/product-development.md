# Product Development Workflow üöÄ

This guide covers product planning, development cycles, and release processes for [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) products.

## Product Philosophy üéØ

### Core Principles

1. **Ship Fast**: Rapid iteration beats perfect planning
2. **User-Focused**: Build what users need, not what we assume they want
3. **Open Source First**: Community feedback drives development
4. **Performance Matters**: Speed and efficiency are features
5. **Simplicity Wins**: Easy to use beats feature-rich

### Development Values

- **Bias to action**: Start building, iterate quickly
- **Data-driven**: Measure impact, not activity
- **Minimal viable**: Ship smallest useful increment
- **Continuous improvement**: Every release makes things better

## Feature Development Lifecycle üîÑ

### 1. Discovery & Planning

**Identify need** through:

- User feedback (GitHub issues, Discord, community)
- Performance analysis and benchmarks
- Competitive research
- Internal use cases

**Evaluate against**:

- User impact (who benefits, how much?)
- Technical feasibility (effort vs value)
- Strategic alignment (fits vision?)
- Resource availability (capacity to build?)

### 2. Design & Specification

**For major features**:

- Write brief design doc (problem, solution, alternatives)
- Define success metrics
- Create minimal specification
- Get feedback from team

**For small features**:

- Clear GitHub issue with use case and approach
- Quick design discussion if needed

### 3. Implementation

Follow [development workflow](development.md):

- Create feature branch
- Build incrementally
- Write tests alongside code
- Document as you go
- Submit PR when ready

### 4. Review & Iteration

- Code review for quality
- Testing for correctness
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation review
- Iterate based on feedback

### 5. Release

- Merge to main when approved
- Include in next release
- Update changelog
- Announce to community

## Release Process üì¶

### Versioning

Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes

Example: `11.0.0` ‚Üí `11.1.0` (new feature) ‚Üí `11.1.1` (bug fix)

### Release Schedule

- **Minor releases**: Every 2-4 weeks
- **Patch releases**: As needed for critical fixes
- **Major releases**: When introducing breaking changes

### Release Checklist

- [ ] All CI tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Version numbers bumped
- [ ] GitHub release created
- [ ] PyPI package published
- [ ] Announcement prepared

### Hotfix Process

For critical bugs:

1. Create `hotfix/` branch from latest release tag
2. Fix issue, add test
3. Fast-track review
4. Release patch version immediately
5. Backport to main if needed

## Feature Prioritization üìä

### High Priority

- Critical bugs affecting users
- Performance improvements
- Security issues
- Highly requested features (10+ community requests)

### Medium Priority

- Quality of life improvements
- New export formats
- Extended platform support
- Documentation improvements

### Low Priority

- Nice-to-have features
- Minor optimizations
- Edge case handling

### Deprioritized

- Features for single user
- Overly complex implementations
- Maintenance-heavy additions
- Out of scope for core mission

## Metrics & Success üìà

### Key Metrics

- **GitHub Stars**: Community interest
- **PyPI Downloads**: Adoption rate
- **Issue Response Time**: Support quality
- **PR Merge Time**: Development velocity
- **[Performance Benchmarks](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/benchmark/)**: Speed/accuracy improvements

### Feature Success Criteria

Define before building:

- Usage metrics (downloads, API calls)
- Performance targets (speed, accuracy)
- User feedback (GitHub reactions, comments)
- Adoption rate (percentage using feature)

## Communication üí¨

### Internal

- **GitHub Issues**: Feature proposals and bugs
- **Slack**: Quick discussions and updates
- **Team Meetings**: Weekly syncs on priorities

### External

- **GitHub Discussions**: Community feedback
- **Discord**: User support and engagement
- **Blog Posts**: Major feature announcements
- **Documentation**: Release notes and guides

## Product Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

## Best Practices ‚úÖ

### Feature Development

- **Start small**: MVP first, expand later
- **User testing**: Get feedback early
- **Performance first**: Optimize from the start
- **Document well**: Write docs while building

### Release Management

- **Test thoroughly**: CI + manual testing
- **Clear changelog**: What changed, why it matters
- **Smooth upgrades**: Backwards compatibility when possible
- **Quick fixes**: Don't let bugs linger

### Community Engagement

- **Responsive**: Reply to issues within 24 hours
- **Transparent**: Share roadmap and decisions
- **Appreciative**: Thank contributors
- **Inclusive**: Welcome all skill levels
