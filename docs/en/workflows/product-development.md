# Product Development Workflow 🚀

This guide covers product planning, development cycles, and release processes for [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) products.

## Product Philosophy 🎯

### Core Principles

1. **Ship Fast, Learn Faster**: 2-week iteration cycles, MVP-first approach
2. **User-Centric**: Build features users request most, validate with data
3. **Open Source First**: Public development, community feedback drives roadmap
4. **Performance is a Feature**: Sub-ms inference times, minimal memory footprint
5. **API-First Design**: Simple, intuitive APIs that developers love

### Development Values

- **Bias to action**: Prototype in days, ship in weeks, not months
- **Data-driven decisions**: GitHub stars, PyPI downloads, Discord polls guide priorities
- **Minimum Viable Product**: Release 80% solution fast, iterate to 100%
- **Continuous deployment**: Main branch is always production-ready
- **Radical transparency**: Public roadmap, open metrics, community input

## Feature Development Lifecycle 🔄

### 1. Discovery & Planning (Week 1)

**Identify needs** through:

- **User feedback**: GitHub issues (votes), Discord polls, community surveys
- **Usage analytics**: Feature adoption rates, API endpoint metrics, error logs
- **Performance data**: Benchmark results, inference times, memory usage
- **Competitive analysis**: Track competitor releases, market trends
- **Internal dogfooding**: Use our own tools, identify pain points

**Evaluate against**:

- **User impact**: How many users affected? Pain level (1-10)? Revenue impact?
- **Technical feasibility**: Engineering effort (S/M/L/XL)? Dependencies? Risks?
- **Strategic alignment**: Advances YOLO11 leadership? Supports key verticals?
- **Resource availability**: Team capacity? Competing priorities? Timeline?
- **Competitive urgency**: Will competitors ship first? Lock-in risk?

**Output**: Prioritized feature backlog with effort estimates and user impact scores

### 2. Design & Specification (Days 1-3)

**For major features** (>2 weeks engineering time):

- **Design doc**: Problem statement, proposed solution, alternatives considered, success metrics
- **Technical spec**: API design, architecture diagrams, data models, edge cases
- **Success criteria**: Quantitative metrics (speed, accuracy, adoption) and user feedback targets
- **Risk assessment**: Technical risks, dependencies, rollback plan
- **Team review**: Feedback from engineering, product, and key stakeholders

**For small features** (<1 week engineering time):

- **GitHub issue**: Clear problem description, proposed approach, acceptance criteria
- **Quick discussion**: 15-min sync with relevant engineers
- **Go/No-go**: Manager approval to proceed

**Output**: Approved spec with clear scope, success metrics, and timeline

### 3. Implementation (Sprint Execution)

**Sprint planning** (every 2 weeks):

- **Sprint goal**: One clear objective per sprint
- **Task breakdown**: Split features into <1 day tasks
- **Capacity planning**: Account for meetings, PR reviews, support
- **Dependencies**: Identify blockers, coordinate with other teams

**Daily execution**:

- **Morning standup** (15 min): Yesterday's progress, today's plan, blockers
- **Focus time**: 4-6 hours deep work, minimize meetings
- **PR reviews**: Review teammate PRs within 4 hours
- **End-of-day updates**: Slack progress update, move tickets

**Development best practices**:

- **Feature flags**: Deploy dark, enable gradually
- **Test coverage**: Write tests before shipping (>80% coverage target)
- **Documentation**: Update docs in same PR as code
- **Performance**: Benchmark before/after, no regressions
- **Security**: Run security scans, fix critical issues immediately

Follow detailed [development workflow](development.md) for PR process and code standards.

### 4. Review & QA (Parallel with Implementation)

**Code review** (required for all PRs):

- **<24 hour response time**: Senior engineers prioritize reviews
- **Quality checks**: Code correctness, test coverage, performance impact
- **Security review**: Automated scans + manual review for sensitive code
- **Documentation**: Verify docs updated, examples work
- **Approval required**: 1+ senior engineer approval before merge

**QA process**:

- **Automated testing**: Unit, integration, E2E tests run on every commit
- **Manual testing**: QA engineer validates key user flows
- **Performance testing**: Benchmark against baseline, flag regressions
- **Cross-platform**: Test on CPU, GPU, edge devices
- **User acceptance**: Beta test with select users for major features

**Iteration cycle**:

- Address feedback immediately, don't accumulate technical debt
- Re-test after changes, verify fixes don't break other features
- Update tickets with progress, keep stakeholders informed

### 5. Release & Launch

**Pre-release checklist**:

- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Changelog updated with user-facing changes
- [ ] Migration guide (if breaking changes)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured

**Release process**:

1. **Merge to main**: Approved PRs merge automatically
2. **Version bump**: Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
3. **Tag release**: Create GitHub release with changelog
4. **PyPI publish**: Automated deployment to Python Package Index
5. **Docker update**: Build and push new container images
6. **Docs deploy**: Documentation site updates automatically

**Launch communication**:

- **Blog post**: Technical deep-dive for major features
- **Social media**: X, LinkedIn, Discord announcements
- **Email newsletter**: Notify 50K+ subscribers
- **Release video**: YouTube tutorial for complex features
- **Community engagement**: Monitor Discord/GitHub, respond to feedback

**Post-launch monitoring** (first 48 hours):

- Watch error rates, latency, adoption metrics
- Respond to critical bugs within 4 hours
- Hotfix process for breaking issues (<24 hour turnaround)
- Gather user feedback, prioritize quick wins

**Success measurement** (first 2 weeks):

- Adoption rate: % of users upgrading
- Usage metrics: API calls, feature engagement
- Performance: Inference speed, memory usage
- User feedback: GitHub reactions, Discord polls
- Bug reports: Critical vs. minor issues ratio
